**Intertype relation** — the way one type's structure maps onto another's.

## Mapping

Naming (in terms of how the other party’s ego block maps onto your own roles) is as follows:

- Identity — hero-parent (relation with your Ego);
- Duality — soul-child (relation with your Anima);
- Contrary — nemesis-senex (relation with your Shadow);
- Enigma — demon-trickster (relation with your Persona);
- Mirror — parent-hero;
- Activity — child-soul;
- Quasi-identity — senex-nemesis;
- Conflict — trickster-demon;
- Kindred — hero-trickster;
- Semi-duality — soul-senex;
- Mirage — nemesis-child;
- Look-alike — demon-parent;
- Supervisor — trickster-hero;
- Benefactor — senex-soul;
- Beneficiary — child-nemesis;
- Supervisee — parent-demon.

## Dichotomies

### Consonant vs Dissonant

Corresponds to the dichotomy of [rationale vs harmony](https://your-trickster.github.io/dichotomies#rationale-democratic-vs-harmony-aristocratic) for types.

- consonant — types belong to the same side of rationale vs harmony {identity, duality, contrary, enigma, activity, mirror, quasi-identity, conflict};
- dissonant — types on different sides of rationale vs harmony will inevitably end up viewing each other as “evil” in certain situations due to incompatibility of their perspectives on life. For example, the values of alphas and betas are directly conflicting with each other, and so are the values of gammas and deltas {semi-duality, look-alike, kindred, mirage, supervision, benefit}.

### Stagnant vs Brisk

Corresponds to the dichotomy of [perception vs judgment](https://your-trickster.github.io/dichotomies#judgment-rational-vs-perception-irrational) for types.

- brisk — a difference of perspectives that often carries an invigorating, but also sharp quality, which may serve as a point of conflict {mirror, activity, quasi-identity, conflict, supervision, benefit};
- stagnant — lack this difference in perspectives, which often causes an effect of stagnation {identity, duality, contrary, enigma, semi-duality, look-alike, kindred, mirage}.

### Parallel vs Convergent

Corresponds to the dichotomy of [evolution vs involution](https://your-trickster.github.io/dichotomies#evolution-vs-involution) for types.

- parallel — progress parallelly, which can make communication between them easier {identity, duality, contrary, enigma, supervision, benefit};
- convergent — the progress of these types ends up coagulating together. Can have difficulties tracing each other’s logical process due to differences in how they lay out information, even if their actual logic is quite correspondent, which can in cases of poor communication serve as a point of conflict. But the difference in approaches can prove productive when their efforts are joint {mirror, activity, quasi-identity, conflict, kindred, semi-duality, mirage, look-alike}.

## Tetrachotomies

### Ponenda-correspondent

This tetrachotomy corresponds to [the ponenda](https://your-trickster.github.io/tetrachotomies#ponenda) for types.

- **inhibiting** (consonant, stagnant, parallel) — the types belong to the same ponendum, meaning they’ll always be on the same page. Interactions don’t require much effort, and due to how easy it is to get along these relations carry an inhibiting effect {identity, duality, contrary, enigma};
- **enabling** (consonant, brisk, convergent) — the difference in perspectives and approaches in these relations can serve as a basis for conflict, but with proper handling promotes growth and proves effective — the types enable each other’s activity {mirror, activity, quasi-identity, conflict};
- **dispiriting** (dissonant, stagnant, convergent) — these relations are characterized by a lack of special mutual interest — participants may even like each other and be supportive, but it’ll never be quite deep enough {kindred, semi-duality, mirage, look-alike};
- **intriguing** (dissonant, brisk, parallel) — they are characterized by a special kind of interest in the other person, an intrigue — and an almost irrational one, but at the same time with disappointment {supervision, benefit}.

One could say, for example, that legacy and emotion are intriguing ponenda to each other.
