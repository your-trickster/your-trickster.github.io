**Intertype relation** — the way one type's structure maps onto another's.

## Mapping

Naming (in terms of how the other party’s ego block maps onto your own roles) is as follows:

- Identity — hero-parent (relation with your Ego);
- Duality — soul-child (relation with your Anima). Note: generally the most preferable of relations;
- Contrary — nemesis-senex (relation with your Shadow);
- Enigma — demon-trickster (relation with your Persona);
- Mirror — parent-hero;
- Activity — child-soul;
- Quasi-identity — senex-nemesis;
- Conflict — trickster-demon;
- Kindred — hero-trickster;
- Semi-duality — soul-senex;
- Mirage — nemesis-child;
- Look-alike — demon-parent;
- Supervisor — trickster-hero;
- Benefactor — senex-soul;
- Beneficiary — child-nemesis;
- Supervisee — parent-demon.
