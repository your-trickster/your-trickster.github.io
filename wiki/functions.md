## Functions

**Sensation** — concrete logical reasoning. Sense of aesthetics. Control. Limits, perceiving objects as discrete, what exists.

**Intuition** — logical reasoning with absent particulars. Potentials, perceiving objects as continous, with indefinite borders, what doesn't exist.

**Thinking** — rule-based value judgment.

**Feeling** — harmony-concerned value judgment.

## Function-attitudes

### Perceiving function-attitudes:

**Introverted sensation (Si)** — self-control (inner limits), consistency, bodily senses and understanding of physical comfort, familiarity (what exists in relation to the subject). Deductive reasoning. Steady.

**Extraverted sensation (Se)** — external control (outer limits), obtainment, tools and resources, actions, application of physical force, embracing the wholeness of the object in sensations. Analogical reasoning. Forceful.

**Introverted intuition (Ni)** — vision (motivations and goals, desires, dreams, fantasies), potentials for oneself. Inductive reasoning. Vain.

**Extraverted intuition (Ne)** — concepts, refinement, probabilities, understanding people. Abductive reasoning. Anxious.

### Judging function-attitudes (“concerned with”):

**Extraverted thinking (Te)** — authority, ethics (“what’s right” objectively), tradition, education, efficiency (applying the least effort possible, preserving resources), opinions and beliefs. Cold.

**Introverted thinking (Ti)** — clarity (having a coherent understanding), morals (“what’s right” subjectively). Rough.

**Extraverted feeling (Fe)** — external harmony (including, but not limited to, group harmony), equity and justice. Warm.

**Introverted feeling (Fi)** — internal harmony (mental and physical comfort — “what brings me serenity”), natural boundary-setting. Soft.

## Dichotomies

### Judgment (rational) vs Perception (irrational)

- judgment — the process of applying a value to information. Judging function-attitudes have nothing to do with “understanding” things, they’re merely a filter. Thinking and feeling;
- perception — intake and production of information. Sensation and intuition.
 
Introverted vs extraverted (see: [essentials](https://your-trickster.github.io/essentials)).

### Revision vs Conduction

- revision — extraverted perception (Pe) and introverted judgment (Ji);
- conduction — introverted perception (Pi) and extraverted judgment (Je).

## Tetrachotomies

### Axes

**Axis** — a pair of aspects of different functions that are both judging or perceiving, but differ in extraversion vs introversion and revision vs conduction. Both function-attitudes of an axis are either ego-syntonic or ego-dystonic. They are inseparable and work in tandem.

Judgment and perception are not equivalent. Judgment cannot exist without perception, but perception can exist without judgment (though it would be not too useful). So a judging axis' values' resolution depends on the perceiving axis it's paired (is ego-syntonic or ego-dystonic together) with.

- NeSi — adaptation. Controlling the internal environment to adapt to the possibilities of the external environment. Conforms to the judgment values;
- NiSe — change. Controlling the external environment to adapt it to the possibilities of oneself. Rebels against the judgment values.

- TiFe — social. What’s right to myself and how it relates to the external environment;
- TeFi — societal. What’s right objectively and how it relates to my inner world.

### Orbits

"**Orbit**" is a way to refer to a pair of aspects of the same function.

### Poles

**Pole** — a pair of function-attitudes of the same energetic (one side of judgment vs perception, introversion vs extraversion and revision vs conduction).

- Ji — compass. Subjective values, reactive rigidity;

- Je — articulation. Objective values, proactive rigidity;

- Pe — exploration. Proactive fluidity. Tuned to what’s going on in the outer world, seeks information outside. Establishes relations between objects (which for, example, may manifest as concrete analogies for Se and metaphors for Ne);

- Pi — channel. Reactive fluidity. Tuned to what’s going on in the inner world, seeks information within.
