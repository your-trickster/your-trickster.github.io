# Functions

Sensation — concrete logical reasoning. Sense of aesthetics. Control. Limits.

Intuition — logical reasoning with absent particulars. Potentials.

Thinking — rule-based value judgment.

Feeling — harmony-concerned value judgment.

# Function-attitudes

Perceiving function-attitudes:

Introverted sensation (Si) — self-control (inner limits), consistency, bodily senses and understanding of physical comfort, familiarity. Deductive reasoning. Steady.

Extraverted sensation (Se) — external control (outer limits), obtainment, tools and resources, actions, application of physical force. Analogical reasoning. Forceful.

Introverted intuition (Ni) — vision (motivations and goals, desires, dreams, fantasies), potentials for oneself. Inductive reasoning. Vain.

Extraverted intuition (Ne) — concepts, refinement, probabilities, understanding people. Abductive reasoning. Anxious.

Judging function-attitudes (“concerned with”):

Extraverted thinking (Te) — authority, ethics (“what’s right” objectively), tradition, education, efficiency (applying the least effort possible), opinions and beliefs.

Introverted thinking (Ti) — clarity (having a coherent understanding), morals (“what’s right” subjectively).

Extraverted feeling (Fe) — external harmony (including, but not limited to, group harmony), equity and justice.

Introverted feeling (Fi) — internal harmony (mental and physical comfort — “what brings me serenity”), natural boundary-setting.

# Dichotomies

Judgment (rational) vs perception (irrational):

	•	judgment — the process of applying a value to information. Judging function-attitudes have nothing to do with “understanding” things, they’re merely a filter. Thinking and feeling.
	•	perception — intake and production of information. Sensation and intuition.
 
Introverted vs extraverted (see: extraversion vs introversion).

Revision (static) vs conduction (dynamic):

	•	revision — extraverted perception (Pe) and introverted judgment (Ji). Wary;
	•	conduction — introverted perception (Pi) and extraverted judgment (Je). Brash.
