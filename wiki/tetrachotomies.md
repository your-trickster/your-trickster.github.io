**Tetrachotomy** — division of a set into four subsets. A tetrachotomy can be expressed as a combination of three dichotomies, each of which can be derived by recombination of the other two.

## Symmetric tetrachotomies

### Quadras

The quadras are a tetrachotomy where the types have the same ego-syntonic function-attitudes, leading to the types' values being in many ways aligned.

Dichotomies:

- [rationale vs harmony](https://your-trickster.github.io/dichotomies#rationale-vs-harmony);
- [judicious vs decisive](https://your-trickster.github.io/dichotomies#judicious-vs-decisive);
- [social vs societal](https://your-trickster.github.io/dichotomies#social-vs-societal).

Subsets:

- **α** (NeSi + TiFe — rationale, judicious, social) — satisfaction and discovery; vengeful ("everyone must get what they deserve", though unlikely to be actively seeking vengeance in a normal state). Freedom to share information. Afraid of having their mouth shut. Lightheartedness, justice, being caring, empathy, a pleasant athmosphere, tender touches, preference for a lack of concern about outside affairs (though not necessarily a lack in reality). TiFe + NeSi – upkeep fairness, morality and justice, voice the harsh truth;
- **β** (NiSe + TiFe — harmony, decisive, social) — intimacy and validation; hypocritic (being nice for the sake of controlling a social setting; twisting morality and justice). Freedom to fight off traumatic events. Afraid of having to be forced out. Agressive seizure of resources, sadomasochism, interpersonal manipulation, practical intelligence. Ti + NiSe – twist their own principles, Fe + NiSe – use others' feelings and group harmony for their own benefit, bend justice;
- **γ** (NiSe + TeFi — rationale, decisive, societal) — purpose and reverence; needful (focusing on individual needs, efforts and accomplishments). Freedom to follow one's will. Afraid of having their hands tied. Competition for the right to own resources, active opposition to authority and traditions, societal manipulation, individualism, privacy, gift giving, seriousness. Te + SeNi – fight authority, bend ethics, Fi + NiSe – use their own feelings as a tool to further their goals;
- **δ** (NeSi + TeFi — harmony, judicious, societal) — authority and justification; egotistic (projecting their lack of clarity onto others to cope with their own feelings). Freedom to realize one's creative potential. Afraid of having their wings clipped. Conformism, traditions, peacefulness, understatement. Te + SiNe – upkeep traditions, and they also both refine Fi and have ego-syntonic Si, so pay the most attention to their emotional and physical comfort, willing to neglect many things for it.

### Ponenda

The ponenda are a tetrachotomy where the types form each other's main archetypes — Ego, Anima, Shadow and Persona. A ponendum reflects general motivations and approaches to life.

Dichotomies:

- [rationale vs harmony](https://your-trickster.github.io/dichotomies#rationale-vs-harmony);
- [judgment vs perception](https://your-trickster.github.io/dichotomies#judgment-vs-perception);
- [evolution vs involution](https://your-trickster.github.io/dichotomies#evolution-vs-involution).

Subsets:

- **legacy** (rationale, judgment, involution) — driven by a need to leave a tangible legacy, are often willing to sacrifice themselves for results {TeNi, FiSe, TiNe, FeSi};
- **passion** (rationale, perception, evolution) — driven by their passions and interests, pursuit of where it is and what is better {NeTi, SiFe, NiTe, SeFi};
- **emotion** (harmony, perception, involution) — do not suppress emotions and desires, use any means necessary to make life easier {SiTe, NeFi, SeTi, NiFe};
- **happiness** (harmony, judgment, evolution) — leave things as they are, do not consider too much excessive, live blindly, but happily {TeSi, FiNe, TiSe, FeNi}.

### Clubs

The clubs are a tetrachotomy where the types have the same active functions, ending up focusing on similar activities.

Dichotomies:

- [rationale vs harmony](https://your-trickster.github.io/dichotomies#rationale-vs-harmony);
- [intuition vs sensation](https://your-trickster.github.io/dichotomies#intuition-vs-sensation);
- [thinking vs feeling](https://your-trickster.github.io/dichotomies#thinking-vs-feeling).

Subsets:

- **NT** (rationale, intuition, thinking) — Researchers/Theoretics (potential for thinking — true rationale) {NeTi, TiNe, NiTe, TeNi};
- **SF** (rationale, sensation, feeling) — Pioneers/Socials (limit to feelings — fake harmony) {FeSi, SiFe, FiSe, SeFi};
- **NF** (harmony, intuition, feeling) — Humanitarians/Idealists (potential for feelings — true harmony) {NeFi, FiNe, NiFe, FeNi};
- **ST** (harmony, sensation, thinking) — Soldiers/Practicals (limit to thinking — fake rationale) {TiSe, SeTi, TeSi, SiTe}.

### Mentalities

Types have the same mental blocks, so one could say within this group lies the preference in terms of what one wants to be like, a shared mentality.

Dichotomies:

- [rationale vs harmony](https://your-trickster.github.io/dichotomies#rationale-vs-harmony);
- [revision vs conduction](https://your-trickster.github.io/dichotomies#revision-vs-conduction);
- [diversification vs unification](https://your-trickster.github.io/dichotomies#differentiating-vs-unifying).

Subdivisions:

- **Qi** (rationale, revision, differentiation) — a certain distancing from the rest of society, support of individual freedoms. Judge people based on their inner world and development, mores and individual features {NeTi, FiSe, TiNe, SeFi};
- **De** (rationale, conduction, unification) – embracing society by either occupying a niche or transforming it, valuing one's own inner continuous and integral identity, needs and desires, individual will. Judge others based on their actions and intentions {NiTe, FeSi, TeNi, SiFe};
- **Qe** (harmony, conduction, differentiation) – place the most value on belonging to a group, being a part of society, often aspire to elitarism. Judge others based on their status {TeSi, NiFe, SiTe, FeNi};
- **Di** (harmony, revision, unification) – being the best, reducing people to the role they occupy. Don't like excessive complexity in people. Judge others based on their social role {TiSe, NeFi, SeTi, FiNe}.

Note: the current description of mentality groups is experimental and, thus, considered not fully reliable.

## Asymmetric tetrachotomies

### Interaction styles

Types in their normal moods have a similar way of interacting with others.

Dichotomies:

- [informativeness vs directiveness](https://your-trickster.github.io/dichotomies#informative-vs-directive);
- [introversion vs extraversion](https://your-trickster.github.io/dichotomies#introversion-vs-extraversion);
- [progress vs outcome](https://your-trickster.github.io/dichotomies#progress-vs-outcome).

Subdivisions:

- **dominant** (directing, extraverted, outcome) — lead people to getting to the goal as soon as possible with direct orders, supervize others, mobilize resources {TeSi, TeNi, FeNi, SeTi};
- **creative** (informing, extraverted, progress) — share insights, explore the options, brainstorm, discover new ways of seeing things, get others involved {NeTi, NeFi, SeFi, FeSi};
- **supportive** (informing, introverted, outcome) — strive to get the best result, support or navigate from behind the scenes, encourage, accomodate, define specifications {TiNe, FiSe, SiFe, FiNe};
- **obligative** (directing, introverted, progress) — chart the course of action, plan, outline logistics, monitor and guide others {NiTe, TiSe, SiTe, NiFe}.

### Rhetorical appeals

This tetrachotomy is based on correspondence to the Aristotelian rhetorical appeals.

The asymmetry of this tetrachotomy stems from the differences between intuitive and sensing types – intuitives appeal to the abstraction corresponding to their side of rationale vs harmony, while sensors appeal to their concrete perceptions (as well as adjoint Je for Si).

Dichotomies:

- [systematic vs nomadic](https://your-trickster.github.io/dichotomies#systematic-vs-nomadic);
- [pragmatic vs idealistic](https://your-trickster.github.io/dichotomies#pragmatic-vs-idealistic);
- [abstract vs concrete](https://your-trickster.github.io/dichotomies#intuition-vs-sensation).

Subdivisions:

- **logos** (systematic, pragmatic, abstract) — appeal to logic (not necessarily logical), intellect, analysis, the rationale behind things {NT club};
- **pathos** (nomadic, idealistic, abstract) — appeal to emotions (not to be confused with emotionality), ideals and meanings, harmony {NF club};
- **ethos** (systematic, idealistic, concrete) — appeal to a need to upkeep certain objective values, the already established, rules, needs and logistics {Si ego};
- **kairos** (nomadic, pragmatic, concrete) — appeal to the need and right to act, the right time, stimulation, desires, performance, resources {Se ego}.
