## Function-attitudinal roles

Hero — the conscious identity. Axial opposite of the soul, orbital opposite of the nemesis, polar opposite of the demon.

Parent — protector of the child and the ultimate excuse. Axial opposite of the child, orbital opposite of the senex, polar opposite of the trickster.

Child — obsessive excuse. Axial opposite of the parent, orbital opposite of the trickster, polar opposite of the senex.

Soul — the point of comfort. Axial opposite of the hero, orbital opposite of the demon, polar opposite of the nemesis.

Nemesis — a natural strength that is ignored until necessary. Axial opposite of the demon, orbital opposite of the hero, polar opposite of the soul.

Senex — an object of critique and a way to criticize others. Axial opposite of the trickster, orbital opposite of the parent, polar opposite of the child.

Trickster — a point of ignorance and pain. Axial opposite of the senex, orbital opposite of the child, polar opposite of the parent.

Demon — a point of neglect. Axial opposite of the nemesis, orbital opposite of the soul, polar opposite of the hero.

The terminology was introduced by John Beebe (albeit is slightly altered). Refers to which role is the primary of which archetype. Usually non-capitalized when referring to the positions.

## Positional dichotomies

### Ego-syntonic vs Ego-dystonic

- ego-syntonic — complimentary to the Ego’s values (“I like”, “I value”); hero, parent, child, soul;
- ego-dystonic — adversary to the Ego’s values (“I dislike”, “I devalue”); nemesis, senex, trickster, demon.

### Matrix (spine, accepting) vs Core (hands, producing)

- matrix — taken seriously; hero and soul (as well as nemesis and demon);
- core — excuse for the matrix; parent and child (as well as senex and trickster).

### Active vs Passive

- active — paid attention to as an area of activity; hero/nemesis and parent/senex;
- passive — not paid attention to as an area of activity; soul/demon, child/trickster.

### Optimistic (inert) vs Pessimistic (contact)

- optimistic — hero/nemesis and child/soul orbits. Unbalanced excitation-inhibition. Careless use;
- pessimistic — parent/senex and soul/demon. Balanced excitation-inhibition. Careful use.

### Exterior vs Interior

- exterior — in line with the hero’s attitude; demonstrated to the outer world; hero, child, senex, demon;
- interior — not in line with the hero’s attitude; hidden from the outer world; parent, soul, nemesis, trickster.

### Mental vs Vital

- mental — concurring for consciousness (“I want to be like”); hero, parent, demon, trickster;
- vital — subdued by the mental (“I have no desire to be like”); nemesis, senex, soul, child.

## Positional tetrachotomies

### Blocks

- **ego** block (ego-syntonic, active, mental) — hero-parent;
- **superid** block (ego-syntonic, passive, vital) — soul-child;
- **id** block (ego-dystonic, active, vital) – nemesis-senex;
- **superego** block (ego-dystonic, passive, mental) — demon-trickster.

## Four main archetypes

Ego — the main lens by the means of which one sees the world. Based around the ego block. “conscious”

Persona — a way to adapt to the collective. Based around the superego block. “preconscious”

Shadow — the mechanism of suppressing ego-dystonic informational contents in favor of the Ego. Based around the id block. “unconscious” (not to be confused with the broader notion of the unconscious)

Anima — the mechanism of repressing ego-syntonic informational contents in favor of the Persona. Based around the superid block. “subconscious”
