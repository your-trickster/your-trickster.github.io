**Dichotomy** — a division of a set into two subsets. In the context of psychological types the word is used to denote balanced dichotomies — ones where both sides are equally sized — specifically.

A dichotomy is called symmetric if it's directly derivable from the original four Jungian dichotomies via tetrachotomial recombination. As noted by Grigory Reinin, there are 15 such dichotomies, including the original four.

The rest of dichotomies are the asymmetric ones. Some of them were introduced by David Keirsey (due to a mistake, perhaps), but other authors, primarily Linda Berens, helped make sense of them.

## Symmetric dichotomies (13/15)

### Introversion vs Extraversion

- introverted types have subjective exterior roles. Drawing libido to the subject, they in a normal state more so respond to the object, which is especially notable in communication with extraverts;
- extraverted types have objective exterior roles. Drawing libido to the object, they oftentimes more so engage with it, which is especially notable in communication with introverts.

Note: it _is not_ about sociability or energizing.

It is a Jungian dichotomy.

### Intuition vs Sensation

- intuitive types have active intuition. Because of that they focus more on potentials rather than limits;
- sensing types have active sensation. Because of that they focus more on limits rather than potentials.

It is a Jungian dichotomy.

### Thinking vs Feeling

- thinking types have active thinking. Because of that they may tend to pose as more serious or logical, but it doesn't mean they are;
- feeling types have active feeling. Because of that they may tend to give things a living quality, but it doesn't make them actually more emotional or illogical.

It is a Jungian dichotomy.

### Judgment vs Perception

- judging type have a judging matrix and a perceiving core. Neurobiologically, they have a little higher activity of the left side of the prefrontal cortex. They are more certain about their conclusions. Tend to be more organized due to reacting slowly and, thus, needing to create rigid structure in order to process things more effectively;
- perceiving types have a perceiving matrix and a judging core. Neurobiologically, they have a little higher activity of the right side of the prefrontal cortex. They are more uncertain about their conclusions. More fluid and adaptable, less organized.

Also called rational vs irrational.

It is a Jungian dichotomy.

### Revision vs Conduction

- revisers have mental Ji + Pe and vital Je + Pi. Engage fluidly, respond rigidly. More of a random, spontaneuous energetic. Wandering or disengaging eyes, halting or restlessness. Wary;
- conductors have mental Je + Pi and vital Ji + Pe. Engage rigidly, respond fluidly. More of a channeled, expressive energetic. Fixed gaze or shakes and pushes, stillness or active articulation. Brash.

### Judicious vs Decisive

- judicious types have ego-syntonic NeSi. They’re characterized by indecisiveness, more careful planning, greater enjoyment of physical comfort regardless of whether they prioritize it (Fi), which is also related to physical grooming. More connected to nature, often conflict-avoidant, more collaborative;
- decisive types have ego-syntonic NiSe. They’re characterized, as the name suggests, by decisiveness, as well as greater desire to plan things overall and to accomplish a specific vision. They’re more driven by material accumulation and power.

### Social vs Societal

- social types have ego-syntonic TiFe. They’re more focused on the social and morality as a concept;
- societal types have ego-syntonic TeFi. They’re more focused on the societal and ethicality as a concept.

### Rationale vs Harmony

The reason this dichotomy exists is the inequaility of judgment and perception described on the [axes](https://your-trickster.github.io/functions#axes) page.

- rationale-oriented types have NeSi paired with TiFe and NiSe paired with TeFi. From the Ne + Ji perspective, rationale types refine their clarity and strive to be consistent in it (Ti + NeSi), having to acknowledge reality. Rationale types are more so progressive, as they do not refine traditions (Te). Rationale types pursue equity (Ne + Fe) and oppose authority (Te + Se). Upkeep morals (Ti + Si). Rationale types are more so empathetic (Ne understands people, Fe focuses on others' feelings and Ti strives to be clear). They focus more on their unknowns than their knowns;
- harmony-oriented types have NeSi paired with TeFi and NiSe paired with TiFe. From the Ne + Ji perspective, harmony types refine their comfort (Ne + Fi) instead of clarity (that is not to say they can’t possibly strive to know something). Harmony types are more so conservative, as they upkeep traditions (Te + Si). They don’t oppose authority as a concept (Te + Si), either complying or seeking to obtain it. Upkeep ethics (Te + Si). Harmony types are more so sympathetic (Ne understands people, Fi focuses on their own feelings). They focus more on their knowns than their unknowns.

### Differentiating vs Unifying

- diversifying types are wary about their unknowns and brash about their knows. They are more inclined towards debates, “questioning” the opponent or even themselves. Negative emotions and conflict easily arising in interactions with others, more easily irritated. Elitarian in a way, as they more clearly see the difference between themselves and others. In group interactions tend to expect a distance between people {rationale ↔ revision, harmony ↔ conduction};
- unifying types are brash about their unknowns and wary about their knowns. The theme of this is normalization. May tend to be less irritable, more optimistic. In group interactions they tend to expect some unity between people {rationale ↔ conduction, harmony ↔ revision}.

Note: some details are experimental and derived from statistics.

### Evolution vs Involution

- evolutionary types are certain about their knowns and uncertain about their unknowns, so their progress ends up flowing naturally and directly, they themselves being emerged in the process. May be more focused on "the past" or societal standards, regardless of their actual intention towards them {passion and happiness ponenda};
- involutionary types are certain about their unknowns and uncertain about their knowns, so their progress has a warped, inverse direction, which may result in things like omitting details or jumping between hypotheses. May be more focused on "the future", regardless of their actual intention towards it {legacy and emotion ponenda}.

### Positivism vs Negativism

- negativists introvert their unknowns and extravert theit knowns. Just like conductors are more brash in extraverting their certainties, negativists are more closed from new information than positivists are, more skeptical (but it's not to be confused with certainty of judgment, liminality of sensation or unwillingness to consider of harmony) {rationale introverts, harmony extraverts};
- positivists extravert their unknowns and introvert their knowns. By analogy with the dichotomy of revision vs conduction, they are more open to new information (not to be confused with the colloquial notion of optimism, uncertainty of perception, potentiality of intuition or truth-orientation of rationale) {rationale extraverts, harmony introverts}.

### Constructivism vs Emotivism

- constructivists have optimistic feeling and pessimistic thinking. Thus, the sphere of feelings is imbalanced for them, and their thinking they're not as confident in, ending up being more neurotic;
- emotivists have optimistic thinking and pessimistic feeling. Feelings are not overindulged in, this sphere is more flexible for them, while thinking is quite immovable.

### Accords vs Discords

- accord types have optimistic intuition and pessimistic sensation (optimistic about potentials, flexible about limits). Trust their intuition, but don't think they understand structure enough to go off their own thinking;
- discord types have optimistic sensation and pessimistic intuition (inflexible about limits, pessimistic about potentials). Don't trust their intuition, but think they understand structures enough to go off their own thinking, which may tend to be black-and-white.

## Asymmetric dichotomies

### Informative vs Directive

- informative types are more prone to sharing information, insinuating and disclosing various kinds of details {Fi ego and alpha quadra};
- directive types are more prone to being dominant and commanding and ordering people around {Ni ego and ST club}.

6/8 informative types are rationale-oriented, 6/8 directive types are harmony-oriented.
That is because rationale types strive to be clear and do not like hierarchical conditions, however NiTe and TeNi are too driven to their goal and cold to be informing.
ST club doesn't like excessive questioning, NiFe and FeNi are, likewise, driven to their goals, but NeFi and FiNe are too anxious and soft to be directing.

### Systematic vs Nomadic

- systematic types tend to think more so in terms of structure, frameworks, procedures, rules and laws behind things {Si ego (consisent), NT club (theoretical)};
- nomadic types tend to think more so in terms of ideals, emotions, personal gains and motives behind things {Se ego and NF club}.

### Progress vs Outcome

- progress types focus more on the getting to the goal itself {[creatives, obligatives](https://your-trickster.github.io/tetrachotomies#interaction-styles)};
- outcome types focus more on the products and the end results {[dominants, supportives](https://your-trickster.github.io/tetrachotomies#interaction-styles)}.

Note: the description is hypothetical.

### Pragmatic vs Idealistic

- pragmatic — preferring straightforwardness in communication, independence and individual initiative, caring about effectiveness of methods {NT club, Se ego};
- idealistic — preferring interdependence and affiliation, checking in with norms and ideals, people-focused {NF club, Si ego}.

Most pragmatic types are rationale types (as they refine individual thinking), most idealistic types are harmony types (as they refine group thinking). However, Si + Fe ego types are way too focused on coexistence to be pragmatic, while Se + Ti ego types are way too forceful and limiting towards others to be affilitative.

### Lazy vs Proactive

- lazy types have demon, trickster, soul or nemesis Se. Pi tends to have a state of lax inertia, whereas Ne ego is polarly opposed to the active nature of Se. Tend to be less active {Ne ego and Pi};
- proactive types have hero, parent, child or senex Se. Je tends to be more assertive of an energetic, and Se ego directs energy towards actions and movement in the outer world. Tend to be more proactive, getting things done {Se ego and Je}.

6/8 lazy types satisfy qualities such as introversion, irrationality, judiciousness or intuition. 6/8 proactive types satisfy qualities such as extraversion, rationality, decisiveness or sensstion.
